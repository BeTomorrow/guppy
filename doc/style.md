## CSS styling

The following CSS selectors will provide access to various elements of the editor:

* `.guppy_active`: The guppy div when it is active.  For example, one
  can use the `border` property of this class to cause the editor to
  have a glowing blue border when active.

* `.guppy_inactive`: The guppy div when it is inactive.  For example,
  set the `background-color` of this class to a share of grey to
  grey out the editor when inactive.

* `.guppy_active .main_cursor`: The span for the main cursor.  CSS
  animations can be used, for example, to make the cursor blink.
