[DONE] Left paren should have current:1, current_type:null

[DONE] Right paren should have current:1, current_type:null, and should
behave like right arrow

[IGNORED] Maybe do not auto-bracket infinitesimal

[DONE] Make help reference card with shift-arrows and shift-/

[DONE] current_type:token should include if at the beginning and the
previous thing is an f

[DONE] Enter should take you up a level as well as down a level

[DONE] After right-ing out of an f node, should not be on top of node, but
rather should be in the next e node

[DONE] Add \left and \right for the grey square brackets

[DONE] cursor needs to be small in exponent even if exponent is complex
with subexpressions

[DONE] int needs to be small if in an exponent--i.e. no displaystyle.
This is hard.  Maybe for now, 'smi/smd' for small integral/definite
integral.

[DONE] home/end go to home/end of current subexpression

[STACK DONE] Undo stack or tree

[DONE] / for big frac, Shift-/ for slash

[DONE] Should have instructions for int/defi on separate lines. Was
confused about how to do defi and took several readthroughs to figure
it out

[DONE] Add summation

[DONE] Selecting a region and typing does not overwrite it; it should do so.

[DONE] The keystroke sequence (ac)^2 gives rise to too many
brackets

[IGNORED] "Typing tan followed by left paren should not add a new
bracket"

[DONE probably] For (4), [Tester] had lots of trouble getting entire
numerator above the line (he typed the whole numerator and then typed
'/'); finally did it after a few tries by typing "frac" at the
outset. But, then, couldn't figure out how to get back into the
fraction after finishing the numerator. He expected hitting 'left' to
move the cursor into the numerator, and then hitting 'down' to move it
into the denominator.

type a fraction a/b, type undo, undo, ... -- the undo gets stuck at
removing the fraction

[KaTeX team says cssId PR rebase in the works] Mouse for moving cursor
and for selection

[DONE] Copy sin(x)cos(x) and paste.  Comes out as cos(x)sin(x)

[DONE] 1+2+3+4, select 2+3, press (, success except cannot render because of
LaTeX error until you move the cursor some.

[DONE] Deleting * doesn't work

[DONE] Give f nodes types in attribute.

[DONE] Have blacklist for disallowed types.

[DONE] Allow f nodes to have named arguments

Allow keymap for arguments (e.g. if key is pressed when in this
argument, what to do)
