	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>

	A WYSIWYG mathematical expression editor with output that is suited to computer as well as human use, and that is easier than raw LaTeX.
	
	<h2>Who is it for?</h2>

	<p>Anyone who wants math input that is easy for novices to enter (such as in an educational context) and/or that is readable by computers (such as in a web based calculator application).</p>

	<p>Specifically, the needs of two target audiences have guided the development to date:

	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p><b>Students learning mathematics online: </b>It is intended make it easy both for students to input and for software to validate mathematical expressions.  The input interface should be simpler than LaTeX, faster than clicking through menus of symbol options, and the results should be parseable so that inputs can be evaluated.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li><p><b>Research mathematicians: </b>It should be easier for researchers to search for mathematics.  More computer-readable storage for mathematical expressions may allow search engines of the future to discern whether "H^2" is "H squared" or "degree-2 cohomology".  This project aims to make entering both of these interpretations easier than LaTeX would, while also including the information needed to distinguish them.</p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	 
	<h2>How is it different from other equation editors?</h2>

	<p>The output is semantically tagged.  Now, you can distinguish whether dy/dx means "derivative of y with respect to x" or "quotient of the product d times y by the product d times x".</p>

	<p>Also, in its default configuration it requires neither backslashes nor use of the mouse to enter expressions.</p>
	
	<h2>Why can't it output to Maple/SymPy/Sage/[My favourite language]?</h2>

	<p>The simple answer is that you could make it do so.</p>

	<p>The much better answer is that, in most cases, you shouldn't. </p>

	<p>Specifically, if you want to take user input and have the editor output it as, say, SymPy for processing on the server side, then this has been intentionally made difficult since such a setup almost always permits a malicious (or merely curious) user to easily take over the server.  Removing builtins will not save you, chroot will not save you, and containers will also probably not save you.  If the significance of <pre>().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()</pre> is lost on you, you definitely shouldn't do this.  Even if you understand why that is relevant, you still most likely should not do this.</p>

	<p>If you want to process your mathematical expressions server-side, then consume them as data (probably via the syntax tree output) and evaluate them with the usual recursive process.  Convenience methods exist in the code for doing this in Javascript.</p>

	<h2>Can I make the cursor orange?</h2>

	Yes.  Many elements are tagged with CSS classes so that you can write CSS to customise the editor's appearance.  !important.

	<h2>What are the future plans for this editor?</h2>
	
	<p>If PostScript is the assembly language of typesetting, then perhaps LaTeX is the C, and this XML format can be one of many competing higher-level languages for specifying mathematical formulae.  Not optimal for all use-cases, but addressing positively the needs of a few.</p>

	<p>A consequence of leaving plaintext, however, is that tooling needs to be created, both for creating and consuming content:

	  <ul>
	    <li><b>Creating:</b> To make it easier to create whole documents using the editor will require plugins for existing document editors such as, among others, Quill.js, CodeMirror, TiddlyWiki, possibly even emacs.</li>
	    
	    <li><b>Consuming:</b> To ensure that users can take advantage of the semantic understanding of equations now available, we envision a tool a bit like a programming IDE, except for reading mathematics.  For example, a tool that allows cross-referencing any symbol in an expression with its definition and uses.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Why "guppy"?</h2>

	I truly don't remember.  /usr/share/dict/words may have played a role.
	
	<h2>Why XML?</h2>
	
	Because it is easy to get out of.  When the day comes that a nicer format comes along that can be as easily and declaratively queried and transformed, it will be a simple matter to XSLT any lingering XML specimens into the new hot sauce.

	<h2>Why Javascript?</h2>
	
	Because it was there.

	<h2>Can it do matrices?</h2>
	
	Yes!  Type "mat"

	<h2>Can make toast?</h2>

	No!

	<h2>It doesn't work on my browser!</h2>
	
	I've tested it on recent versions of Firefox and Chrome and some
	version of Safari.  Also, on IE11.  It didn't work on IE11.
	
	<h2>I miss backslashes!</h2>
	
	Fine.  Have it your way.  They are included, but optional, with a
	configuration option to make them required if you choose.
	
	<h2>Is it mobile friendly?</h2>
	
	It comes with an on-screen keyboard module that can be used to input from a phone or tablet.  Try it out <a href="/site/examples/osk">here</a>.

	<h2>Is it secure?</h2>

	<pre>Set-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration -Identity $SECURITY -AutoReplyState Enabled -ExternalMessage "Thanks for you report.  We take security very seriously and somone will contact you regarding your report.  Have a nice day."</pre>

	<h2>Is it Web 3.0 compliant?</h2>

The planned port to HTML9 Responsive Boilerstrap JS is planned.
